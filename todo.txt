TODO:

queue endpoints for watering. basically a redis boolean key. polling the endpoint does logic on when to text.
  - if dry enough and haven't texted user in a while, text user
  - go check if there is a water boolean in this queue

  - if so, return true and record that we watered. otherwise, false

water_plant endpoint:
  - puts in a "true" boolean into the water queue for this plant. also records when it was enqueued

user support for owning "plants"

cookie storage, does username and then falls through to cookie

mobile app pages:
- my account (see all plants and their names). each entry in list goes to a plant
- plant view -- adjust dryness wanted here. see when last watered?
- water prompt (to water a specific plant maybe? just first for now)
- after water (yay, you have watered your plant. show history? last time watered? water dates array?)

extra credit:
- bitly shortening automagically!
